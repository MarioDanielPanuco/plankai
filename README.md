I'd like to thank Patrick _ for making the Shorelark tutorial that provided as the foundation for this codebase. 

Project is adapted from _'s tutorial project Shorelark
The repository for the project is _.

This project aims at simulating swarm intelligence for small artificial plankton hives.

# Plankton Agents 
Plankton agents aim to locate and decompose microplastics in the ocean,
as well as locate and absorb carbon dioxide in carbon dense spaces. 


## Disclaimer
The technology for powering the artificial plankton is theoretical, which is why I'm focusing mainly on simulation
as a way of training the artificial intelligence.



### TODO
    * Introduce the nalgebra library as the backbone of the neural network (easier scaling to a 3D space)
    * Introduce tournament and boltzman selection as options to the genetic algorithm
    * Add mapping to regions in the space
    * Better statistic analytics on the webpage     
    * Export statistics as it's own file for more in-depth analyzing
