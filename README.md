I'd like to thank Patrick Wychowaniec for making the Shorelark tutorial that provided as the foundation for this codebase. 

Project is adapted from Patrick's tutorial project Shorelark
The repository for the project is can be found at [github](https://github.com/Patryk27/shorelark).

This project aims at simulating swarm intelligence for small artificial plankton hives.

# Plankton Agents 
Plankton agents aim to locate and decompose microplastics in the ocean,
as well as locate and absorb carbon dioxide in carbon dense spaces. 


## Disclaimer
The technology for powering the artificial plankton is theoretical, which is why I'm focusing mainly on simulation
as a way of training the artificial intelligence.


### TODO
    * Introduce the nalgebra library as the backbone of the neural network (easier scaling to a 3D space)
    * Tournament selection - DONE 
    * Boltzman selection
    * Add mapping to regions in the space
    * Better statistic analytics on the webpage     
    * Export statistics as it's own file for more in-depth analyzing
